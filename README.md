# Oregon Healthcare website retrospective
Gathering research and documents related to the Cover Oregon website development failure.

## Open Questions
1. Where's the source code?
I assume someone has already tried to FOIA it and I just haven't found it. If this was a failed infrastructure project citizens would be able to see the partial completion of the bridge or road to at least know how far along the project was. I have more research to do, but I have no sense for how close they got to actually launching the site.
2. What's been released as part of the ongoing lawsuits?
There's 6 different lawsuits related to the project. How much was publicly released as part of those trials?

### Oregon vs. Oracle: Legal war gets personal as company goes on the attack
#### article1
[Updated Jan 09, 2019; Posted Apr 08, 2016] 
https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2016/04/oregon_vs_oracle_war_gets_pers.html
- "Oracle claims the state tipped off a reporter about how to remove redactions in state documents hiding snippets of damaging Oracle internal emails."
    - Where are these unredacted emails?
- "Oracle was the primary contractor"
    - Who are the secondary / other contractors?
- "The dispute has led to six lawsuits, including the main case playing out in Marion County Circuit Court, in which the state has accused Oracle of fraud and racketeering and is seeking $6.5 billion in damages."
    - What's the outcome from these 6 different lawsuits.
- "Oracle was paid over $240 million to deliver an exchange that never worked"
    - That's more than the $200M figure I've heard previously.
- "By March 2014, after years of development and more than $300 million in costs, then Gov. John Kitzhaber pulled the plug on the Cover Oregon technology effort."
    - Does that $300M figure include the state's costs?
- "Oracle's narrative is radically different. It claims its team delivered a functional health care exchange by February 2013. But Kitzhaber opted to dump the technology and claim it never worked."
    - Um what? It "worked" but they never shipped it? Seems like they'd want to show / leak some proof of that if it's true.
- "Oracle launched a lobbying campaign intended to convince local business, political and media officials that the state was botching the Oracle litigation nearly as badly as it bungled the Cover Oregon effort."
    - Was all this lobbying private / behind closed doors? Is there any evidence of this lobbying?
- "[Oracle] has categorized 97 percent of the documents it provided to the state in the discovery process as confidential or for attorney's eyes only."
    - Are the remaining 3% at least publicly available?
- "In January, the state asked Marion County Circuit Court Judge Courtland Geyer to force Oracle to declassify some of those half a million pages of documents that "support plaintiff's claims and undermine Oracle's false media campaign that the health insurance exchange 'worked' in February 2014."
Oracle argued the state simply wanted to leak the documents to reporters, who would write stories embarrassing to the company."
    - More public information would be great.

### Documents Oracle Doesn't Want You To Read About Cover Oregon - Audio Interview
#### article2
[Nick Budnick Portland Tribune Feb. 22, 2016 5:30 p.m.]
https://www.opb.org/news/article/documents-oracle-doesnt-want-you-to-read-about-cover-oregon/
- Audio interview with Nick Budnick.
    - "State of Oregon does not come out looking good in these"
    - "Oracle's work fails the laugh test" ~ Oracle employee
    - Oracle blames the State for failing to hire an oversight contractor. Which the State rejects because they claim the company recommended they NOT hire an oversight contractor.
    - March 2012 Oracle exec is quoted in an internal email that they tried to keep the State from hiring an oversight contractor.

### Documents damning on Oracle's Cover Oregon release
#### article3
[Nick Budnick Feb. 22, 2016]
- "Last month [Jan 2016] the Oregon attorney general’s office submitted a 24-page brief in Marion County Circuit Court arguing that Oracle was wrongly classifying its internal documents as confidential."
    - Link to brief?
- "Last week, however, the Pamplin Media Group gained access to a version of the brief without the redactions."
    - Very interesting.
- "One company assessment in November 2013 found its software development “didn’t pass the ‘laugh test.’”"
- "That a Nov. 22, 2013, internal email appears to contain two typos, one Oracle developer wrote that an “army” of programmers for the company was “rapoing the state f Oregon on something that will never work well.”"
    - Wow.
- "concerns about the project prompted Oracle’s founder, billionaire Larry Ellison, to request daily progress reports in a Nov. 16, 2013, email."
    - That's crazy if it escalated all the way up to Ellison.
    - How big was this project for Oracle? What are their annual revenues?
        - In FY13 Oracle had $27.4B in software revenues - which a assume this falls under because their other line items are hardware and services. https://s1.q4cdn.com/289076952/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2014/q2fy14-detailed-financials-2087031.pdf
