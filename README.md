# Oregon Healthcare website retrospective
Gathering research and documents related to the Cover Oregon website development failure.

## Open Questions
1. Where's the source code?
I assume someone has already tried to FOIA it and I just haven't found it. If this was a failed infrastructure project citizens would be able to see the partial completion of the bridge or road to at least know how far along the project was. I have more research to do, but I have no sense for how close they got to actually launching the site.
2. What's been released as part of the ongoing lawsuits?
There's 6 different lawsuits related to the project. How much was publicly released as part of those trials?
