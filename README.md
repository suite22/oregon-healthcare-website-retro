# Oregon Healthcare website retrospective
Gathering research and documents related to the Cover Oregon website development failure.

## Open Questions
1. Where's the source code?
I assume someone has already tried to FOIA it and I just haven't found it. If this was a failed infrastructure project citizens would be able to see the partial completion of the bridge or road to at least know how far along the project was. I have more research to do, but I have no sense for how close they got to actually launching the site.
2. What's been released as part of the ongoing lawsuits?
There's 6 different lawsuits related to the project. How much was publicly released as part of those trials?

### Oregon vs. Oracle: Legal war gets personal as company goes on the attack
#### article1
[Updated Jan 09, 2019; Posted Apr 08, 2016] 
https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2016/04/oregon_vs_oracle_war_gets_pers.html
- "Oracle claims the state tipped off a reporter about how to remove redactions in state documents hiding snippets of damaging Oracle internal emails."
    - Where are these unredacted emails?
- "Oracle was the primary contractor"
    - Who are the secondary / other contractors?
- "The dispute has led to six lawsuits, including the main case playing out in Marion County Circuit Court, in which the state has accused Oracle of fraud and racketeering and is seeking $6.5 billion in damages."
    - What's the outcome from these 6 different lawsuits.
- "Oracle was paid over $240 million to deliver an exchange that never worked"
    - That's more than the $200M figure I've heard previously.
- "By March 2014, after years of development and more than $300 million in costs, then Gov. John Kitzhaber pulled the plug on the Cover Oregon technology effort."
    - Does that $300M figure include the state's costs?
- "Oracle's narrative is radically different. It claims its team delivered a functional health care exchange by February 2013. But Kitzhaber opted to dump the technology and claim it never worked."
    - Um what? It "worked" but they never shipped it? Seems like they'd want to show / leak some proof of that if it's true.
- "Oracle launched a lobbying campaign intended to convince local business, political and media officials that the state was botching the Oracle litigation nearly as badly as it bungled the Cover Oregon effort."
    - Was all this lobbying private / behind closed doors? Is there any evidence of this lobbying?
- "[Oracle] has categorized 97 percent of the documents it provided to the state in the discovery process as confidential or for attorney's eyes only."
    - Are the remaining 3% at least publicly available?
- "In January, the state asked Marion County Circuit Court Judge Courtland Geyer to force Oracle to declassify some of those half a million pages of documents that "support plaintiff's claims and undermine Oracle's false media campaign that the health insurance exchange 'worked' in February 2014."
Oracle argued the state simply wanted to leak the documents to reporters, who would write stories embarrassing to the company."
    - More public information would be great.
- "He castigated his own company for bringing an "army" of programmers to Oregon who were "rapoing [sic] the state f [sic] Oregon on something that will never work well."
Oracle claimed the email was taken out of context."
    - What other context would improve this remark?
- "Rather than wait for January and the scheduled start of the trial, he [Geyer] has recently ordered the combatants into mediation."
    - Does that mean fewer documents and proceedings will be made public?

### Documents Oracle Doesn't Want You To Read About Cover Oregon - Audio Interview
#### article2
[Nick Budnick Portland Tribune Feb. 22, 2016 5:30 p.m.]
https://www.opb.org/news/article/documents-oracle-doesnt-want-you-to-read-about-cover-oregon/
- Audio interview with Nick Budnick.
    - "State of Oregon does not come out looking good in these"
    - "Oracle's work fails the laugh test" ~ Oracle employee
    - Oracle blames the State for failing to hire an oversight contractor. Which the State rejects because they claim the company recommended they NOT hire an oversight contractor.
    - March 2012 Oracle exec is quoted in an internal email that they tried to keep the State from hiring an oversight contractor.

### Documents damning on Oracle's Cover Oregon release
#### article3
[Nick Budnick Feb. 22, 2016]
- "Last month [Jan 2016] the Oregon attorney general’s office submitted a 24-page brief in Marion County Circuit Court arguing that Oracle was wrongly classifying its internal documents as confidential."
    - Link to brief?
- "Last week, however, the Pamplin Media Group gained access to a version of the brief without the redactions."
    - Very interesting.
- "One company assessment in November 2013 found its software development “didn’t pass the ‘laugh test.’”"
- "That a Nov. 22, 2013, internal email appears to contain two typos, one Oracle developer wrote that an “army” of programmers for the company was “rapoing the state f Oregon on something that will never work well.”"
    - Wow.
- "concerns about the project prompted Oracle’s founder, billionaire Larry Ellison, to request daily progress reports in a Nov. 16, 2013, email."
    - That's crazy if it escalated all the way up to Ellison.
    - How big was this project for Oracle? What are their annual revenues?
        - In FY13 Oracle had $27.4B in software revenues - which a assume this falls under because their other line items are hardware and services. https://s1.q4cdn.com/289076952/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2014/q2fy14-detailed-financials-2087031.pdf
- "“Oracle has never worked on a project of this size and complexity without a systems integrator in place,” according to a PowerPoint presentation Oracle shared with members of Congress."
- "If the state hired an integrator, it “could displace or reduce our role significantly,” wrote the Oracle executive, according to a version of the state’s brief: “It isn’t clear what we can do about this other than pray that they keep deferring the SI (systems integrator) selection. But since hope is not a strategy, this topic deserves some discussion.”"
    - quote from an unnamed Oracle executive.
- "As the company argued in its federal lawsuit, “That decision was akin to an individual with no construction experience undertaking to manage the processes of designing and building a massive multi-use downtown skyscraper without an architect or general contractor.”"
    - But Oracle claimed they would fill that role, at least the State claims.
- "The public could get a chance to see the full documents after March 10, when a Marion County Circuit Court judge will consider whether to unseal them."
    - Where are these documents?!
##### Claims made in the comments of the article
- "Deollitte got paid a nice amount as well to come in later and try to fix the IT problems.
Several CO people quit and sued the State, not Oracle. 
Why is that?"
    - Are there any records showing Deloitte's perspective?
    - Did former contractors sue the state directly?

### State to pay $1.3 million to official ousted after Cover Oregon fiasco
#### article4
[Jeff Manning, Updated Jan 09, 2019; Posted Apr 12, 2017]
https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2017/04/state_to_pay_13_million_to_off.html
- "Carolyn Lawson contends she was made a scapegoat for the failure of the state and its contractors to construct a working health care exchange website. The former chief information officer for the Oregon Health Authority claimed senior state officials covered up the truth, content to let her take the fall."
- "She quit in December 2013 under threat of getting fired."
- "She's been unable to find work in information technology due to her role in Cover Oregon, her lawyers said."
    - What is she doing now?
        - Is this the same person? @carolynlawson
- "The two sides settled in September, with Oracle agreeing to pay the state $25 million in cash and another $75 million worth of software and services."
    - Wow so is that the final resolution of everything? That's a tiny pay out, compared to the damages they were seeking initially.
- ""Caroline feels vindicated by the results in this case," said Kyle Busse, one of her attorneys. "The amount the state was willing to pay speaks for itself.""

### Oregon Attorney General sues Oracle for “racketeering activity”
#### article5
[Sean Gallagher, 8/25/2014, 9:34 AM]
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-for-racketeering-activity/
- "The 126-page complaint, filed by Rosenblum in Oregon’s Marion County Circuit Court on August 22, claims that Oracle pushed the state to not hire a systems integrator for the project, giving the company total control over the development of the site and allowing company executives to conceal problems with the software."
    - Thankfully they included a link to the actual filing! Interesting that it's hosted by OregonLive.
        - http://media.oregonlive.com/health_impact/other/FINAL%20Complaint%208_22_14.pdf
- "... which allowed the company to conceal problems with software and essentially bill for fixes to the software that should have been covered under the license agreements for the software itself, the attorney general asserted."
    - Is that because the underlying system Oracle was re-using were shared software systems created by Oracle for other project? Essensially, billing for fixes to the "commons" part of the software?

### Cover Oregon: Oracle comes out swinging, files lawsuit, accuses Kitzhaber of 'campaign'

    - ? What? Cover Oregon sued Oregon or Oracle? And why only $23M?
