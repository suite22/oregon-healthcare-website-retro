http://media.oregonlive.com/health_impact/other/FINAL%20Complaint%208_22_14.pdf

“...Overcharging for poorly trained Oracle personnel to provide incompetent work...” p1

$240,280,008 p2

“HIX-IT Project” is the project code name for the Healthcare exchange. The social services upgrade was just called “Modernization Project”. P3

“Oracle Consulting Services” was their recommendation for doing the systems integration. 
- I assume Oracle still offers systems integration services? What are some examples for successful projects they’ve integrated?
- This says the state spent “millions more” on the consulting services. I wonder what the number actually was?

“Oracle not only was responsible for all technology, it tightly controlled access to the software development environments, so that the State had to rely on Oracle’s demonstrations and reports to learn about Oracle’s progress on the Projects.” P4
- How much of these environments was turned over or reported on during the lawsuits?

Section 7 on page 4 is where things get interesting. The state handed over the project to the newly created Cover Oregon - “a State-created public corporation responsible for running Oregon’s health insurance exchange.” It just says the transition happed in 2013 and the site was set to launch on Oct 1st 2013. Oracle said it was nearly 80% complete, but when did they give that estimate? “Cover Oregon relied on Oracle’s statements and entered contracts with Oracle to complete the HIX-IT project.” 
- I don’t understand why / how the contracts transferred like that. Was there new money allocated?

By the summer of 2013 they reduced scope to drop the section of the site to allow small businesses to signup for health insurance. 

“Without the website portal that the State and Cover Oregon had already paid Oracle more than $100,000,000 to build...” p5
- So then how much was ultimately paid to Oracle?

“In April (2014?) Cover Oregon staff identified 1198 errors that required repair....” 
- I assume these were bug reports or JIRA tickets? I’d love to see some of these tickets.

“One developer experienced in Oracle products called Oracle’s programming ‘atrocious’. He added that ‘they broke every single best practice that Oracle themselves have defined. It is one of the worst assessments I have performed’ The same developer wrote to Oracle, ‘You are Oracle people, working on an Oracle hardware platform, with Oracle technology products, on an Oracle solution. Oracle should be delivering these environments and products as a solution, like they actually understood the products and owned the solution which has not been the case by a long shot.”  
- Who is this person? How can I find them?

“A former Oracle employee was more direct saying Oracle’s products were seemingly configured ‘by a kindergartner.’” p6
- Who is this person? How do I find them?

“On August 8 2014 Oracle filed a lawsuit riddled with false and irrelevant allegations against Cover Oregon...” p7 
- Need to read that one too. I want to hear Oracle’s side of the story.

Mythics, Inc is a defendant.
- Who the is this? 

Stephen Bartolo Vice President, Engineered Systems and Hardware at Oracle. Named personally in the complaint. 

Thomas Budnar Vice President for North America Government Consulting at Oracle. 

Safra Catz President and Chief Financial Officer at Oracle. 

Kevin Curry Group Vice President for North America Public Sector at Oracle. 

Brian Kim WAS a Technical Manager at Oracle
- Former? Were they fired? They left between the start of the project and this complaint apparently. 

Ravi Puri Senior Vice President for North America Technology and Government Consulting at Oracle.
- How many of these people are still at Oracle? 
- It seems like no one from Oracle really gave comment to the papers during the whole process. Why? What about former employees?

DHS issued a RFI (Request for Information) in Jan 2009. For the modernization project. The lead time on that is surprising.

“Oracle also stated that Siegel Public Sector Case Management, the key product in the ‘Oracle Solution’” 
- Do they have demos on their site? How can I see this thing in action?

Small Business Health Options Program = SHOP
p14

“On August 18, 2010 a dozen Oracle employees made a nearly four-hour presentation to DHS staff at the vendor fair.” p14
- I’d love to see that presentation. Who was actually in the room?

“In October 2010, DHS issued a report summarizing its findings and requesting authorization to proceed with procurement of COTS programs.” p15
- Where’s the report?

Late 2010 two companies were being considered: Oracle and Curam Software.
Who is Curam? An Irish software company with 600+ employees. Large, but nowhere near Oracle.

Oct 2010 US Dept of Health and Human services HHS offered “Early Innovator” grants for states to build exchanges. 

“In Feb 2011, HHS awarded the State an Early Innovator grant of more than $48 million to implement a HIX.” p16

Once the state got the grant they decided to try and get a COTS solution that would solve both HIX and the modernization project. That sounds like a terrible idea from the beginning. The two things aren’t really all that related. 

DHS hired Wakely Consulting Group and KPMG LLP to provide guidance about the proposals. p17
- Are both those groups are in Portland?

“Oracle Policy Automation” a program designed to automatically determine individuals eligibility for government subsidies, social service programs and health insurance. 
- So Oracle had something that in theory did exactly what the state needed. 

“WebCenter, a program to display the website portal.” P17

“Oracle also added that it ‘invests several billion dollars in research and development to meet changing organization requirements’” p18
- What does that mean? 

Vendor questionnaire was sent to Oracle and Curam in March 2011. List of 450 requirements. 
- Where’s that list? Scored from 0-4 on level of effort required. 4 was “out of the box”

“Oracle later claimed that ‘under no circumstances will we recommend’ changes to the underlying application source code” p19

“Oracle scored more than 95% of the DHS’s requirements as a 4”! 
- Wow! That means they didn’t think they even needed to have a business analyst configure it... how?

“Oracle explained that ‘government subject matter experts (not application developers)’ could define rules in OPA ‘in the terms and vocabulary that they are familiar with and/or as defined in relevant statue, regulations and policy documents. There is no scripting or programming needed.” p20 
- How would that even work? Do they have any demos of this even working today? I’d love to see what this scripting language even looks like.

“The presentation also stated that ‘Infastructure and Environment can be stood up in less than 3 weeks from contract ratification.” p21
- Was that done? I assume not.

Curam withdrew from the procurement process in May 2011.
- Why?

May 10-12 2011 they did product demos. 
- Do they have any photos or documents from that? Wakely and KPMG were there.

“Kevin Curry was the highest ranking Oracle employee present throughout the presentations...” p23
